    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is built on top of [`understat-db`](https://github.com/Torvaney/understat-db). The initial setup is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to get started is to populate a local database with `docker-compose`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, clone the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/Torvaney/understat-db.git\n",
    "cd understat-db\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, setup the local environment\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "make env                  # Create a virtualenv and installs the project & dependencies\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtualenv\n",
    "cp .env.sample .env       # Copy default environment vars to .env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the database\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker-compose up -d db   # Start a postgres database within a docker container\n",
    "wingback migrate      # Create base database tables\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, import the data you want\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wingback ingest --leagues EPL --seasons 2020\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backtesting\n",
    "\n",
    "The xG-based models require match simulations to be present in the database. You can generate these with the `resimulate` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wingback resimulate --leagues EPL --seasons 2020\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to backtest the models, you can use the `backtest` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wingback backtest --league EPL --start-date 2021-01-01\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the full suite of models is very large (see `wingback backtest --help`) and takes a long time to run. You can select specific models using the `--models` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this project you will need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python 3.6+\n",
    "* Docker\n",
    "\n",
